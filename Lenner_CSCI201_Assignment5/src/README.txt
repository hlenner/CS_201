Everything works, except removing a player if they lose and resigning a player.
 you can only upgrade a space if you land on that space again and you already
own it. Green piles are bad, red are good. you must press start to have the players appear.Run my program by
selecting the green play button in eclipse, from the Game_Board file. Then select #players, types of animals.
The board will pop up at this point. You can only begin and see the pieces when you click "START." Quit
will exit the game.
